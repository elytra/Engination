# Engination Enginogrammetry
Creative Cosmetic Contraptions and Conventional Curiosities

Originally, this mod also contained industrial automation goodies, and a custom nether.
These have been split into Thermionics and Thermionics|World, respectively. That left me
free to focus each mod down into a cohesive feature set.


## What you'll find here

* Really nice looking blocks that do nothing
* Callouts to some of my favorite games
* Tomatoes you can throw at people, complete with excellent squishes
* Celery that takes more effort to chew than it's worth
* Launchers, gravity fields, and safe-landing pads
* Lock-and-key mechanisms, such as doors that disappear when hit with a particular sword
* Fall-through trap blocks, sprint-through blocks, and more!

Many of these blocks are creative-only, and intended for adventure maps and conventions.
Via a config key, some survival recipes can be enabled, but please be aware that there is
some recipe overlap with Quark.
